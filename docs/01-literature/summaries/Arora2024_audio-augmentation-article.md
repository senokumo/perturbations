## Abstract //todo shorten to summary!
Have you ever wondered how your Alexa understands you so well, even in a noisy room or when you have a cold? This is due to a technique known as data augmentation, which helps applications like speech recognition, music generation, and sound classification become smarter and more reliable.

The creation of data sets for training machine learning models is a difficult task. It requires considerable financial investment and time and sometimes cannot be accomplished due to the different conditions under which a model might work. That‚Äôs where data augmentation comes in handy. Through small manipulations of existing samples of audio, such as background noise or pitch modification, programmers can create a richer and more varied dataset, which they can use to train their model.

## Abstract //todo shorten to summary!
Neural networks have become a powerful tool in pattern recognition and part of their success is due to generalization from using large datasets. However, unlike other domains, time series classification datasets are often small. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel time series data augmentation called guided warping. While many data augmentation methods are based on random transformations, guided warping exploits the element alignment properties of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and shapeDTW, a high-level DTW method based on shape descriptors, to deterministically warp sample patterns. In this way, the time series are mixed by warping the features of a sample pattern to match the time steps of a reference pattern. Furthermore, we introduce a discriminative teacher in order to serve as a directed reference for the guided warping. We evaluate the method on all 85 datasets in the 2015 UCR Time Series Archive with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The code with an easy to use implementation can be found at [this https URL](https://github.com/uchidalab/time_series_augmentation) .

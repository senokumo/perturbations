## Abstract //todo shorten to summary!
We propose the Fr¬¥echet Audio Distance (FAD), a novel,
reference-free evaluation metric for music enhancement algo-
rithms. We demonstrate how typical evaluation metrics for
speech enhancement and blind source separation can fail to ac-
curately measure the perceived effect of a wide variety of dis-
tortions. As an alternative, we propose adapting the Fr¬¥echet In-
ception Distance (FID) metric used to evaluate generative image
models to the audio domain. FAD is validated using a wide va-
riety of artificial distortions and is compared to the signal based
metrics signal to distortion ratio (SDR), cosine distance, and
magnitude L2 distance. We show that, with a correlation coeffi-
cient of 0.52, FAD correlates more closely with human percep-
tion than either SDR, cosine distance or magnitude L2 distance,
with correlation coefficients of 0.39, ‚àí0.15 and ‚àí0.01 respec-
tively.

## Abstract //todo shorten to summary!
Predictive models for music annotation tasks are practi-
cally limited by a paucity of well-annotated training data.
In the broader context of large-scale machine learning, the
concept of ‚Äúdata augmentation‚Äù ‚Äî supplementing a train-
ing set with carefully perturbed samples ‚Äî has emerged as
an important component of robust systems. In this work,
we develop a general software framework for augmenting
annotated musical datasets, which will allow practitioners
to easily expand training sets with musically motivated per-
turbations of both audio and annotations. As a proof of
concept, we investigate the effects of data augmentation
on the task of recognizing instruments in mixed signals.

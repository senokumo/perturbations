## Abstract //todo shorten to summary!
In this work, we introduce VERSA, a unified
and standardized evaluation toolkit designed
for various speech, audio, and music signals.
The toolkit features a Pythonic interface with
flexible configuration and dependency control,
making it user-friendly and efficient. With full
installation, VERSA offers 65 metrics with 729
metric variations based on different configura-
tions. These metrics encompass evaluations
utilizing diverse external resources, including
matching and non-matching reference audio,
text transcriptions, and text captions. As a
lightweight yet comprehensive toolkit, VERSA
is versatile to support the evaluation of a wide
range of downstream scenarios. To demon-
strate its capabilities, this work highlights ex-
ample use cases for VERSA, including audio
coding, speech synthesis, speech enhancement,
singing synthesis, and music generation. The
toolkit is available at https://github.com/
wavlab-speech/versa.

## Abstract //todo shorten to summary!
`pedalboard` is a Python library for working with audio: reading, writing, adding effects, and more. It supports most popular audio file formats and a number of common audio effects out of the box, and also allows the use of [VST3®](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/technologies/vst3.html) and [Audio Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Units) formats for third-party plugins.

`pedalboard` was built by [Spotify's Audio Intelligence Lab](https://research.atspotify.com/audio-intelligence/) to enable using studio-quality audio effects from within Python and TensorFlow. Internally at Spotify, `pedalboard` is used for [data augmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation) to improve machine learning models and to help power features like [Spotify's AI DJ](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-02-22/spotify-debuts-a-new-ai-dj-right-in-your-pocket/). `pedalboard` also helps in the process of content creation, making it possible to add effects to audio without using a Digital Audio Workstation.

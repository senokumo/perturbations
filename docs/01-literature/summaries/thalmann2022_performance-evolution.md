## Abstract //todo shorten to summary!
Evolutionary studies have become a dominant thread in the
analysis of large audio collections. Such corpora usually
consist of musical pieces by various composers or bands
and the studies usually focus on identifying general histor-
ical trends in harmonic content or music production tech-
niques. In this paper we present a comparable study that
examines the music of a single band whose publicly avail-
able live recordings span three decades. We first discuss
the opportunities and challenges faced when working with
single-artist and live-music datasets and introduce solu-
tions for audio feature validation and outlier detection. We
then investigate how individual songs vary over time and
identify general performance trends using a new approach
based on relative feature values, which improves accuracy
for features with a large variance. Finally, we validate our
findings by juxtaposing them with descriptions posted in
online forums by experienced listeners of the band‚Äôs large
following.

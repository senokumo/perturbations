## Abstract //todo shorten to summary!
Recent years have seen considerable advances in audio
synthesis with deep generative models. However, the state-
of-the-art is very difficult to quantify; different studies often
use different evaluation methodologies and different met-
rics when reporting results, making a direct comparison to
other systems difficult if not impossible. Furthermore, the
perceptual relevance and meaning of the reported metrics
in most cases unknown, prohibiting any conclusive insights
with respect to practical usability and audio quality. This
paper presents a study that investigates state-of-the-art ap-
proaches side-by-side with (i) a set of previously proposed
objective metrics for audio reconstruction, and with (ii) a
listening study. The results indicate that currently used ob-
jective metrics are insufficient to describe the perceptual
quality of current systems.

**Structure:**
[Verse 1]  
Take a piece of tinsel and put it on the tree  
Cut a slab of melon and pretend that you still love me  
Carve out a pumpkin and rely on your destiny  
Get in your car and cruise the land of the brave and free  
  
[Chorus]  
But don't forget to understand exactly what you put on the tree  
Don't believe the [florist](https://genius.com/33569251/Ween-roses-are-free/Florist) when he tells you that the roses are free  
  
[Verse 2]  
Take a wrinkled raisin and do with it what you will  
Push it into third if you know you're gonna climb a hill  
Eat plenty of lasagna 'til you know that you've had your fill  
Resist all the urges that make you wanna go out and kill  
  
[Chorus]  
But don't forget to understand exactly what you put on the tree  
Don't believe the florist when he tells you that the roses are free  
Yeah  
  
[Instrumental Break]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Throw the pumpkin at the tree  
Unless you think that pumpkin holds your destiny  
Cast it off into the sea  
Bake that pie and eat it with me  
Throw the pumpkin at the tree  
Unless you think that pumpkin holds your destiny  
Cast it off into the sea  
Bake that pie and eat it with me

- **Verse 1 (0:25–1:05):**
    
    - Lyrics begin: “The ocean is a desert with its life underground…”

- **Chorus 1 (1:06–1:30):**
    
    - Repetition of the main melodic hook
        
    - “The Mollusk…” line sung over the same chord pattern
        
- **Verse 2 (1:31–2:05):**
    
    - Continuation of the narrative
        
    - Maintains the same melody and chords as Verse 1
        
- **Chorus 2 (2:06–2:35):**
    
    - Same as Chorus 1
        
    - Lyrics slightly varied, melody consistent

- **Verse 3 / Chorus 3 (3:16–4:00):**
    
    - Returns to verse/chorus pattern

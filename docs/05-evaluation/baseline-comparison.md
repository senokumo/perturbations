#### Augmented results will be compared to

- No Augmentation - original studio recording only
- Naive random - uniform static random perturbations within bounds
- single perturbation (ablation)
	- tempo-only
	- pitch-only
	- noise-only
	- reverb/fx only

#### Different Pipeline Versions:
- Simple linear Perturbations
- naive random perturbations
- section-aware perturbations
- dynamic global perturbations (LFO-based)
